# AbakhusJS

AbakhusJS is a TypeScript library designed to interact with any blockchain network by utilizing design pattern concepts such as Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton, Composite, and Observer. This approach provides a versatile, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

## Requisites:
1. Abstract Factory: Create an abstraction layer to produce different types of blockchain network clients, each specific to a particular blockchain protocol or network.
2. Factory Method: Implement factory methods within the Abstract Factory to instantiate specific client implementations based on the target blockchain network.
3. Singleton: Ensure a single instance of each blockchain client exists, preserving resources and ensuring consistent state throughout the application.
4. Composite: Use the Composite pattern to represent and manage complex blockchain objects such as smart contracts and accounts, allowing for hierarchical organization and easier interaction.
5. Observer: Employ the Observer pattern to enable event-driven communication and notification for blockchain events (e.g., transaction confirmation, new block) and allow components to subscribe and respond accordingly.
6. Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript's strong type system to define interfaces and types for blockchain clients, smart contracts, and other components.
7. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling strategies for blockchain interactions, including retries and fallback mechanisms.
8. Security: Integrate secure practices such as input validation, sanitization, and private key management.
9. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation and clear API references for users of AbakhusJS.

## Roadmap:
1. Planning and Design:
Define library objectives, use cases, and key abstractions.
Design the architecture incorporating the required design patterns.
2. Development:
Implement the Abstract Factory for creating blockchain clients.
Develop Factory Methods for different network clients.
Implement Singleton for client instances.
Use Composite for complex blockchain objects.
Integrate Observer for event handling and notifications.
Define TypeScript interfaces and types for clarity and safety.
3. Testing and Optimization:
Conduct unit and integration tests for each component.
Optimize performance and memory usage.
4. Documentation:
Create thorough documentation including code examples, usage guidelines, and API references.
5. Release and Maintenance:
Release the library with versioning and changelogs.
Monitor user feedback and make continuous improvements.
Maintain compatibility with new blockchain protocols and updates.
