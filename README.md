# AbakhusJS

AbakhusJS is a TypeScript library designed to interact with any blockchain network by utilizing design pattern concepts such as Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton, Composite, and Observer. This approach provides a versatile, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

## Requisites:
1. Abstract Factory: Create an abstraction layer to produce different types of blockchain network clients, each specific to a particular blockchain protocol or network.
2. Factory Method: Implement factory methods within the Abstract Factory to instantiate specific client implementations based on the target blockchain network.
3. Singleton: Ensure a single instance of each blockchain client exists, preserving resources and ensuring consistent state throughout the application.
4. Composite: Use the Composite pattern to represent and manage complex blockchain objects such as smart contracts and accounts, allowing for hierarchical organization and easier interaction.
5. Observer: Employ the Observer pattern to enable event-driven communication and notification for blockchain events (e.g., transaction confirmation, new block) and allow components to subscribe and respond accordingly.
6. Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript's strong type system to define interfaces and types for blockchain clients, smart contracts, and other components.
7. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling strategies for blockchain interactions, including retries and fallback mechanisms.
8. Security: Integrate secure practices such as input validation, sanitization, and private key management.
9. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation and clear API references for users of AbakhusJS.
